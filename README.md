*Mashing* up bits and pieces to build a feed aggregator and reader.

*Why?* Because Google reader is going away.

*No* I don't think this will be a replacement.  I do plan to finish it to the point where it can be used by me to read feeds.

*And then?* This is an interesting problem space.  Something big will happen in this space. I find that working on code related to a problem space makes me thing about details that would never occur to me otherwise. There are a lot of ideas that will be fun to explore and having this code will give me a place to tinker.
